        <p>During my internship in diploma, i and my 2 groupmates have assigned to complete a website which generate a report in pdf file.</p>
        <p>We need to create a website for a contractor which work under TNB to check and aware of the fire extinguisher expired date.</p>
        <p> Admin is the owner of the company which can insert the company information only once as for their report use. Admin can use</p>
        <p> another function regurlarly just like employee. The project consist of <b>insert, update, delete, edit, check, view and print</b> as their </p>
        <p>function. After login, a pop up of license will be expired shown for both admin and employee to aware where and which fire</p>
        <p> extinguisher need to be change. Then, the employee incharge need to alert and go to the exact location and change the fire</p>
        <p> extinguisher. After all, the system will auto generate a report in pdf file and the employee can print the report as for the reference.</p><br>
